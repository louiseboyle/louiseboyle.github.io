I’m Louise Boyle, a Product Design and Innovation student pursuing an MSci at the University of Strathclyde. I’m passionate about tackling real-world problems through user-centred, research-driven design.

Alongside my studies, I work as a dance educator and retail assistant, experiences that have strengthened my communication skills, adaptability, and understanding of user needs in diverse environments.

My design approach is process-led and detail-focused, spanning sketching, prototyping, and CAD across both physical and digital design. I value collaboration, sustainability, and continuous learning, and I aim to create practical, meaningful solutions that make a genuine impact.
