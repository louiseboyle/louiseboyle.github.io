### Design for Manufacture and Assembly 

The trolley was developed with manufacture and assembly in mind, using a modular frame structure and repeatable components to reduce part count and simplify assembly. Symmetrical frame elements, standardised fixings, and accessible component placement support efficient production, maintenance, and future repair.
