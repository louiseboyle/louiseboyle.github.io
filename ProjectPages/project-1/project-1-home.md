## Motorised Shopping Trolley for the Elderly
### Problem and Purpose 

Many elderly shoppers experience physical strain and fatigue when using conventional shopping trolleys, limiting comfort and confidence during everyday shopping trips. eStride was designed to provide motorised assistance with intuitive control, supporting safer, smoother movement through supermarket environments while maintaining familiarity and ease of use.

### Ideation 


Early ideation explored shopping trolley aesthetics, functionality, and structural integrity to support stability and ease of use.

### Design for Manufacture and Assembly 

The trolley was developed with manufacture and assembly in mind, using a modular frame structure and repeatable components to reduce part count and simplify assembly. Symmetrical frame elements, standardised fixings, and accessible component placement support efficient production, maintenance, and future repair.

### User Interaction and Control 

Design development prioritised intuitive user control, ergonomic adjustment, and clear feedback to support confident use during everyday shopping.

#### Simple Slide Control 
A single-axis sliding handle was developed to provide intuitive forward and reverse control while minimising cognitive load. Speed was deliberately limited to approximately 3.5 mph to prioritise user confidence and safety in busy retail environments.

#### Height Adjustment 
Adjustable handle bars allow the trolley to accommodate a wide range of user heights, supporting ergonomic posture and reducing strain during prolonged use.

#### Long Lasting Power
An integrated rechargeable battery was positioned low within the chassis to improve stability while supporting extended shopping trips. This placement balances weight distribution and enables up to 15 hours of use without compromising manoeuvrability.

#### Prototyping 

A 1:1 scale model of the trolley was designed using CNC cut panels, 3D printed PLA handles and outsourced swivel casters and wheels.
